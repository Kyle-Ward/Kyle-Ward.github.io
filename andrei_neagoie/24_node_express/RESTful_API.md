With RESTFUL APIs devs can define a set of functions to perform requests and receive responses (get, post, put, delete) using HTTP. They make us able to create rules that govern compatibility between front and back ends.

Get - receive a resource
Put - change/update a resource
Post - create a resource
delete - remove a resource

RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each call can be made independently of one another and each call has all the data necessary to complete successfully.

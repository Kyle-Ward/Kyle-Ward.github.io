            <h3>Below is a short summary of major events in Mill's life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1806</strong> - John Stuart Mill is born in Pentonville, Middlesex, the eldest son of the Scottish philosopher, historian and economist James Mill, and Harriet Barrow</li>
                <li><strong>1814</strong> - By the age of eight, he had read Aesop's Fables, Xenophon's Anabasis, and the whole of Herodotus, and was acquainted with Lucian, Diogenes Laërtius, Isocrates and six dialogues of Plato.</li>
                <li><strong>1826</strong> - Mill suffered from severe depression and nihilistic feelings. Eventually, the poetry of William Wordsworth showed him that there was more beauty and joy in the world than his rigorous analytical upbringing allowed for.</li>
                <li><strong>1832</strong> - Mill's philosophical mentor, Jeremy Bentham dies. A few years later his father passes away as well. Their deaths spurred Mill to create his own philosophical systems and ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>1843</strong> - <em>A System of Logic</em> is published. This book is most systematic philosophical work, offering varying thoughts and critiques of various logistic methods.</li>
                <li><strong>1859</strong> - <em>On Liberty</em>, arguably Mill's most important work, is published. <em>On Liberty</em> presents some of the strongest and most profound arguments for the moral and economic freedom of the individual, especially freedom of speech, ever set forth in writing.</li>
                <li><strong>1861</strong> - Mill publishes <em>Utilitarianism</em> in which he bolsters Bentham's philosophy and clears up many misconceptions about it.</li>
                <li><strong>1865-1868</strong> - Mill serves as a member of the British Parliament for City and Westminster.</li>
                <li><strong>1869</strong> - Mill's essay "The Subjugation of Women" is released, advocating for both suffrage and equal education rights for women. This was very controversial in it's time and has led many historians to consider Mill an early proto-feminist.</li>
                <li><strong>1873</strong> - John Stuart Mill dies in Avignon, France.</li>
            </ul>
